 Day 1: some good progress -
        todo: there are many memory leaks. fix this.
              there is no progress on directories, do that
              unziping and combining still needs to be done
 
 Day 2: more progress + added -vv and -c (also fixed memory leaks)
        todo: there is no progress on directories, do that
              unziping and combining still needs to be done
 
 Day 3: added -d/--dirs
        todo: add the unzipping and combining
 
 Day 4: added unzipping and combining
        todo: could make it faster, but it works
 
 Day 5: found some errors that need to be fixed:
        - do more error handling
        - some files are not .png's, but are being renamed as a png
        - some photos are rly 2 photos next to each other
          -> some manga have panels stretch across and the images are 2 in 1
          -> so make [X|Y] into [X] and [Y]
          -> this can be done with libpng, but jpegs != png
